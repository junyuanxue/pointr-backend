## Introduction :arrow_upper_right:
This repository contains the back-end for our final project at Makers Academy, Pointr. It is a mobile navigation app that allows the user to drop waypoints when they go somewhere, and follow the waypoints on their way back without having to rely on textual references to their location.

The Rails back-end serves as an API for our Angular/Ionic front-end ([repo here](https://github.com/junyuanxue/pointr-frontend)) to send data to and fetch information from.

Here is a (sped-up) screen recording of me using the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwkhulsTFYQ&feature=youtu.be

## Testing :white_check_mark:
The code is test-driven with RSpec-Capybara. To run all the tests, simply run `rspec` in your terminal.
