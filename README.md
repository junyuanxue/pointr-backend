# Pointr

## Introduction :arrow_upper_right:
This repository contains the back-end for our final project at Makers Academy, [Pointr](https://github.com/tobenna/waybackApp). It is a mobile app that would allow the user to drop waypoints when they go somewhere, and follow the waypoints on their way back without having to type in any street names or start/end location.

The Rails back-end serves as an API for our Angular front-end to send data to and fetch information from.

## Testing :white_check_mark:
The code is test-driven with RSpec-Capybara. To run all the tests, simply run `rspec` in your terminal.

## Tools :wrench:
